<h2>Here are some of the best movies I've watched in 2023</h2>
<h3>Leo:</h3>
<p>Lokesh Kanagaraj is the main reason why I chose this movie.He's so skilled and this movie is one of his masterpiece.<br /> Vijay's(Hero) role was so good and his true potential and efforts was casted in this movie</p>
<h3>Attack on TItan:</h3>
<p>This anime has captured the heart of many who watched it.Surely you'll get into rollercoaster of emotions.<br />This anime is so brutal and not recommended for those who are sensitive to watch blood splashing or killing.</p>
<h3>Vikram:</h3>
<p>This is also a Lokesh Kanagaraj's masterpiece which has the all time star Kamal Hasan as lead role.<br /> Though Leo and Vikram happens in a different timeline, the director connects it in his own style in the upcoming movies.</p>
